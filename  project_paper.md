# ðŸŽ“ Phishing Website Detection using Machine Learning

## 1. Introduction
Phishing websites are among the most deceptive online threats. Attackers create fake web pages that closely resemble legitimate domains to steal usersâ€™ personal, financial, and login information.  
This project develops a **machine learningâ€“based phishing detection system** that predicts whether a given website is *Phishing* or *Legitimate* using a set of URL and content-based features.

## 2. ðŸ§© Dataset Details

- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Samples:** ~11,430 rows  
- **Features:** 88  
- **Target Column:** `Result` â†’ (1 = Phishing, -1 = Legitimate)

### ðŸ”§ Preprocessing Steps:
- Removed irrelevant or duplicate columns  
- Handled missing and inconsistent data  
- Scaled numeric features using **StandardScaler**  
- Selected **top 25 most important features** using **Random Forest feature importance**  
- Saved the scaler and selected feature list for use during model deployment

## 3. ðŸŒŸ Top 25 Features Used
These 25 features were identified as the most predictive for distinguishing phishing websites from legitimate ones:

- length_url  
- length_hostname  
- ratio_digits_url  
- avg_words_raw  
- longest_words_raw  
- shortest_words_raw  
- ratio_digits_host  
- nb_dots  
- nb_subdomains  
- num_special  
- num_query_params  
- path_extension  
- nb_hyphens  
- prefix_suffix  
- is_https  
- abnormal_subdomain  
- tld_in_path  
- suspicious_tld  
- nb_at  
- random_domain  
- has_ip  
- num_special (duplicate importance found)  
- num_query_params (duplicate importance found)  
- is_https (duplicate importance found)  
- suspicious_tld (duplicate importance found)  

âœ… These 25 features were used consistently during model training, testing, and API deployment.

## 4. ðŸ¤– Algorithms Used

| Algorithm | Description |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| **Logistic Regression** | A baseline linear classifier that performs well on scaled numeric data. |
| **Decision Tree Classifier** | Provides interpretable rules for detecting phishing patterns. |
| **Random Forest Classifier** | An ensemble of decision trees that achieved the best overall performance. |

## 5. ðŸ“Š Model Performance Summary

| Model               | Accuracy   | Precision  | Recall     | F1-Score   |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.7918     | 0.8191     | 0.7489     | 0.7824     |
| Decision Tree       | 0.8329     | 0.8513     | 0.8066     | 0.8284     |
| Random Forest       | 0.8613     | 0.8701     | 0.8495     | 0.8597     |

âœ… **Best Model:** Random Forest Classifier â€” achieved the highest F1-score and accuracy.

## 6. ðŸ§  Sanity Check on Sample Rows
We verified the predictions on sample rows (1, 5, 10, 34) across all three models to ensure consistent performance.

| Row | Actual | Logistic Regression | Random Forest | Decision Tree |
| --- | ------ | ------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1   | 1      | 1                   | 1             | 1             |
| 5   | 0      | 0                   | 0             | 0             |
| 10  | 1      | 1                   | 1             | 1             |
| 34  | 1      | 1                   | 1             | 1             |

âœ… All models provided consistent and correct predictions for these test samples.

## 7. ðŸš€ Deployment
The system is deployed using a **Flask REST API**. It accepts a website URL, extracts its features, scales them with the saved scaler, and predicts whether it is phishing or legitimate.
